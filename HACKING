Contributing the the Gedit Developer Plugins project

The project uses Bazaar for version control and is hosted on Launchpad. You
can get a copying of current code from the console using:

    bzr branch lp:pocket-lint


Code style
----------

Python is expected to conform with PEP8, and running pocket-lint on itself
should report no issues.


Integrating pocket-lint to another tool
---------------------------------------

The three minimal lines required to check the format of a source file are:

    from pocketlint.checkformat import Reporter, check_sources
    reporter = Reporter(Reporter.CONSOLE)
    check_sources(sources, reporter)

`sources` is a list of file paths. `reporter` is the mechanism used to report
issues. Reporter is a sink; the checkers do not know or care about what
happens. You can implement your own Reporter by providing this signature:

    class MyReporter:
        def __call__(self, line_no, message, icon=None,
                     base_dir=None, file_name=None):
