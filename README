General Information
===================

This is version 2.28.0 of gedit-developer-plugins (GDP). GDP are a
set of plugins for gedit that provide additional editing features
for software development. GDP provides:

    * Multi-file find and replace
      Directories and file types can be specified. Regular expressions are
      supported.
    * Syntax completion
      Python completion using the file's imports and definitions. Simple
      word completion based on the words in the file.
      Use <Shift><Control>Space to activate the snippet completer window.
    * Formatting
      Format paragraphs, lists, and imports. Reformat test using regular
      expressions. Check the syntax and style of Python, XML, and plain
      text. Check and reformat Python doctests.
    * Project management via Bazaar DVCS
      integrates bzr-gtk to show status, tags, annotations, visualize,
      commit, merge, and push. Open files changes in the branch.

Installation from tarball
-------------------------

To install the plugins for personal use (in your home directory),
run the following commands from a terminal:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Or you may choose to install the plugins in another location.

    ./configure --without-home --prefix=</path/to/location>
    make
    make install

To install the plugins in the same location as the standard
gedit plugins, set the prefix path to the same as gedit (usually
/usr).

See HACKING for instructions to build the plugins from a branch.


Working versions
----------------

The version number is synced to the gedit version. Plugins may work
with older versions of gedit. Run the following command from a
terminal to run the test suite.

    make test

If the test suite passes, the plugins will probably work. In the past,
API changes to GtkSourceView2 and gtk.Builder were underlying cause of
incompatibilities
