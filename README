General Information
===================

This is version 2.26.0 of gedit-developer-plugins (GDP). GDP are a
set of plugins for gedit that provide additional editing features
for software development.


Installation
------------

To install the plugins for personal use (in your home directory),
run the following commands from a terminal:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Or you may choose to install the plugins in another location.

    ./configure --without-home --prefix=</path/to/location>
    make
    make install

To install the plugins in the same location as the standard
gedit plugins, set the prefix path to the same as gedit (usually
/usr).


Working versions
----------------

The version number is synced to the gedit version. Plugins may work
with older versions of gedit. Run the following command from a
terminal to run the test suite.

    make check

If the test suite passes, the plugins will probably work.


Contrib
-------

GDP includes the work of other projects when it simplifies dependencies.
