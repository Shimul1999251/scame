SyntaxCompleter
===============

The SyntaxCompleter is a gedit plugin that will suggest complete words
that match the part of a word at the cursor.


CompleteModel
-------------

The CompleteModel accepts a dictionary of datatypes and their data. It
builds a gtk.GenericTreeModel by parsing the data for each datatype with
the appropriate parser.

    >>> from gdp.syntaxcompleter import SyntaxCompleter
    >>> data = 'This, that, and the other thing are simple words.'
    >>> print data
    This, that, and the other thing are simple words.
