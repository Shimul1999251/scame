SyntaxCompleterPlugin
=====================

The SyntaxCompleterPlugin is a gedit plugin that will suggest words
to complete the word at the cursor. The word may come from the
vaocabulary of the document, or from the syntax of the document's
language.

The plugin, like the gedit.Plugin objec it decends from does not
require any parameters during initialization.

    >>> from syntaxcompleterplugin import SyntaxCompleterPlugin
    >>> plugin = SyntaxCompleterPlugin()
    >>> plugin
    <SyntaxCompleterPlugin object (GObject) ...>


Gedit Plugin API
----------------

activate()
~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever a new gedit window is created the activate() method of the
plugin is called with one argument, the gedit.Window.

    >>> from testing.helpers import get_fake, get_window
    >>> import gtk
    >>> import gedit
    >>> fake = get_fake()
    >>> fake.data['app_get_default'] = gedit.App()
    >>> window, view, document = get_window('plugins/gdp/data/snark12.txt') 
    >>> plugin.activate(window)


deactivate()
~~~~~~~~~~~~

when a window is destroyed the deactivate function is called.


update_ui()
~~~~~~~~~~~

The update_ui function is called when the plugin is requested to see if
it needs to update its UI.
