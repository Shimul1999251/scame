Gedit plugin API part 1
-----------------------

APIs for starting and using the plugin.


activate()
~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever a new gedit window is created the activate() method of the
plugin is called with one argument, the gedit.Window. The plugin
creates the FindController, and binds it and the window to itself.
It also adds the controller to the view.

    >>> from testing.gedithelpers import get_window
    >>> import gtk
    >>> import gedit
    >>> window, view, document = get_window('plugins/gdp/data/snark12.txt')
    >>> plugin.activate(window)
    >>> plugin.window is window
    True
