Hackerese is an example of how hackers assmble words and symbols.

The underscore (_) is often used to indicate a non-breaking space.
Symbols like "syntax_model" are considered to be one word. Private
variables are often written with a leading underscore (_private).
Python uses double leading and a trailing underscores to indicate
class private (__init__) methods or indentifier conflict resolution
(buffer_). Examples:

    syntax_generator
    syntax_completer
    __call__(self)
    __dict__
    file_
    _dict
