AnyTextChecker
--------------

The AnyTextChecker class is a generic class that uses the rules from
the AnyTextMixin to check any text file.

    >>> from textwrap import dedent
    >>> from gdp.formatcheck import AnyTextChecker

    >>> text = dedent("""
    ...     This line is fine.
    ...     This line has trailing whitespace.  
    ...     <<<<<<< this line has a merge conflict.
    ...     This line exceeds 78 characters making it difficult to read: %s
    ...     """ % '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
    >>> checker = AnyTextChecker('/path/to/file.txt', text)
    >>> checker.check()
    2: Line has trailing whitespace.
    3: File has conflicts.
    4: Line exceeds 78 characters.
